# Agent docs (progressive disclosure)

This folder contains task-specific guidance for working in this repository. The root `AGENTS.md` stays intentionally minimal and links here.

## Index

- `overview.md` — what the project is, key files
- `where-to-change-what.md` — map common tasks to the right modules
- `simulation-invariants.md` — invariants to preserve (indexing, row flip, guards)
- `testing.md` — unit/integration/E2E guidance
- `typescript.md` — TypeScript-specific notes (Vitest mocks, Leva typing)
- `troubleshooting.md` — common build/runtime debugging tips
- `deployment.md` — GitHub Pages deployment trigger
